          I'm a Frontend Developer with a background in non-profit and campaign
          work. I made the career switch into software development because of my
          love of problem solving. I like to be challenged by problems and
          create clever solutions to solve them. There is very little more
          exciting than building out an idea into a application.

          I'm a graduate of Grand Circus' Frontend Bootcamp. I was hooked on
          programming from the very first time I ran a line of my code, and saw
          the result on the screen. I'm interested in working on ambitious
          projects with positive solution-oriented people.

          When I'm not writing code, I'm on the hunt for an incredible cup of
          coffee, enjoying a great soccer game, or challenging myself by
          learning a completely new skill. I can also finish almost any quote
          from the 1984 classic, <em>Ghostbusters</em>.
