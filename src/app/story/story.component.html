        <p>
          I'm a Frontend Developer with a background in non-profit and campaign
          work. I made the career switch into software development because of my
          love of problem solving. I like to be challenged by problems and
          create clever solutions to solve them. There is very little more
          exciting than building out an idea into a application.
        </p>

          I was hooked on programming from the very first time I ran a line of
          my code, and saw the result on the screen. I'm working towards
          becoming a full-stack developer, trying to learn some backend
          technologies as I develop my frontend skills. I'm interested in
          working on ambitious projects with positive solution-oriented people.

          When I'm not writing code, I'm on the hunt for an incredible cup of
          coffee, or enjoying a great soccer game. I can also finish almost any
          quote from the 1984 classic, <em>Ghostbusters</em>.

          Born and raised in Pennsylvania, went to school in Ohio, now living in
          beautiful Michigan.
